# Image Slider
Image Slider Application on ReactJS

### Web Page
https://svitlua.github.io/image-slider/

## Functionality
- The slider has several tiles, each with a hero image, and then an overlay on that with a smaller image and a caption.
- The slider auto-rotates slides every 3 seconds.
- Controls allow to go to the next or previous slide.
- Hovering over the slide stops auto-rotation; auto-rotation resumes when the hover ends.
- The slider gets its source data from a json feed (sliderdata.json)
